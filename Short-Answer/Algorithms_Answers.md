#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Each loop of the while, a increases by n^2. Once a is larger than n^3, it stops. n^3 / n^2 = n, so this will mean an average of n loops. So O(n).


b) Outer loop runs n times. Inner loop runs more than once, but less than n times. So time complexity is O(nlog(n)).


c) The function recurses n + 1 times, so time complexity = O(n).
